# **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Liver Tumor Detection**  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project focuses on detecting **liver tumors** using a **hybrid quantum-classical approach**.  
It utilizes the **LiTS17 dataset**, which contains annotated **liver 3d CT scans**, for model training.  

The system performs **liver and tumor segmentation** using deep learning models like **U-Net**,  
combined with **quantum-inspired algorithms** for enhanced image processing.  

The model classifies **liver tumors as malignant or benign**, leveraging **quantum-based image segmentation**  
techniques to improve accuracy.
